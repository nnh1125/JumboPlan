As a means for developing your design skills, we will discuss the fundamental features of a high level, general purpose programming language \u2014 namely C++ \u2014 and learn how to use it as a tool for problem solving. We will also consider the performance of solutions, and how to apply both analytical and empirical assessment techniques.
